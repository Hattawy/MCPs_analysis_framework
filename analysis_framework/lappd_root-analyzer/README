-- Aug 17, 2017 for the lappd analysis of the MCP-PMTs

- Work: this directory contains:
 1. Sub-directory for the lappd analysis, that converts the binary data 
    files to txt files, then the lappd reads the txt files and processes them
    with selection and cleaning cuts. The output of the lappd is a root file
    that can be used for the root scripts to find the gain, amplitude, ...,
    etc, of the each data set. See the section B in MCPs-analysis-manual.pdf 
    for the analysis details.  

  2. Sub-directory for the root analysis scripts, that reads the lappd
     output root files and prints the histograms of the different quantities.
